## More Info

This pack is a work in progress and is developed as the different logic difficulties are being worked on. It follows Archipelago’s logic, not necessarily matching standalone or higher difficulties at this time. If you encounter any bugs or have any questions, feel free to ask by pinging in Discord the pack maker (@seto10987) or the maintainer (@g4m3rl1f3).
